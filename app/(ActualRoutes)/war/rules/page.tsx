         - DURING YOUR TURN, AFTER 15 SECONDS MAX, IF YOU DON&#39;T DO ANYTHING, YOU WILL BE SKIPPED <br/>
        (womp womp) <br/>
         - This game is designed to be played with 5+ people<br/>
      </b></p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Politics - Ways of rule<br/></h2>
      <ol className="list-inside">
        <li>
          <b> - Communism:</b> you don&#39;t have to pay your civilians, but you only get 50% of the money. Cv-Qol = 0.2
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> - Democracy:</b> normal things, start with more educated people
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> - Fascism:</b> all of the stuff will cost only 50%, but you have to pay your civilians 1.5 times as much and in â…” of the time<br/>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> - Nazism:</b> Facism but money produces + 50% and you have to pay civilians twice as much every turn.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br/>
      <h2>Movement cost - $75 / unit / cm<br/></h2>
      <p>
        Units moved greater than 30 cm will experience significant morale loss.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Usage cost - $100 / unit / use<br/></h2>
      <p>
        You may also blitz, where you can use units multiple times in one turn, <br/>
        but it will cost $(100 * uses^3).
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Encirclement - Debuff (Passive)</h2>
      <p>
        Your opponent&#39;s damage is halved, while yours is doubled, until encirclement is broken<br/> (morale)
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Cities - You can found a city for $1000<br/></h2>
      <p>
         - A military base is 10 medical tents, a military base and an airfield, but is still considered a city.<br/> 
         - It itself can hold 15 units, not counting the base, the tents, and the airfield, thus making up its garrison. <br/> 
         - In order to take an opponent&#39;s city, you need conduct a siege<br/> 
         - All cities start at a fortification class of I, and upgrading it costs $500<br/> 
         - All cities start with a population of 1000
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Siege - Seiging</h2>
      <p>
         - The Fortification Class of cities determines how long it will take for an army to peirce its defences.<br/> 
         - Time = (FortClass * (garrisonMass + 2)) / OpponentStrength :
         - To increase a citiy&#39;s fortification class, it would take 5 turns and 5^previousFC
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Civilians - Mechanic</h2>
      <p>
         - Every 3 turns except the first 6, you must pay $200 * (class)^2 / 2 to your civilians altogether<br/>
         - If you don&#39;t, after the next three turns you will have to play 2.5 times that<br/> 
         - If you still don&#39;t, then there will be a rebellion that I will control<br/> 
         - Your money produced will be halved<br/><br/>
         - Civilians can also contribute to discoveries
         - If you have a population of 10K, qol 0.5, you would have a 1% chance discovery every round<br/>
         - CHANCE OF DISCOVERY PER TURN = (0.01 * POPULATION ^ QOL FACTOR)% 
         - Note: qolFactor = quality of life factor and ranges from 0-1<br/> 
         - So basically, you can either have a well educated and happy population for good stuff, <br/>
        or a sad and stupid population for money<br/> 
         - Education also slightly boosts army strength
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Destroying</h2>
      <p>
         - You can choose to destroy structures, but not living units. <br/>
         - It&#39;s free ðŸ™‚ <br/>
         - Destroying structures will not give you any money.<br/>
         - Feel free to trade (structures only), but movement cost for transport will be doubled.<br/>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Damage - redirection and knockback</h2>
      <p>
         - If you want to attack more than one unit, then you can split the damage between them.<br/>
         - You can also turn some of your damage into knockback. <br/>
         - Knockback hp = Remaining Hp / 2. <br/>
         - If the knockback Hp = 0, then the unit is pushed 5 mm DIRECTLY AWAY from the attacking unit, and knockback Hp resets.<br/>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2><i>Economy - Economics</i></h2>
      <p>
         - Economy is a point-based value that ranges from 1-1000, 1 being nonexistent, 1000 being yay. <br/>
         - Buying war equipment grants you 5% of the cost in economy points. <br/>
         - Losing a unit causes the economy to go down by 5%. <br/>
         - Losing a money maker will cause the economy to go down by (the amount of money produced each turn) / 2.<br/>
         - Everyone starts out with a decent but not amazing economy (500).<br/>
         - If your economy is below 250, then you will have to pay $100 extra for your civilians because they are angy.<br/>
         - If your economy is above 750, then you pay $100 less because civilians like you.<br/>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <h1>Specific Mechanics</h1>
      <br/>
      <h2>Stealth - </h2>
      <p>
        The unit is invisible, but every turn there is a 10% chance that the opponent will see it (for one turn only). 
        The opponent CAN attack random spots in hopes of destroying the stealth unit.
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Military bases - </h2>
        <p>
           - 2 Units&#39; healths increased to 150% in 5 turns<br/>
        </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Missile Interceptors - </h2>
      <p>
         - 75% chance to intercept and disable incoming missle<br/>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Radiation - Debuff</h2>
      <p>
         - Nukes will emit radiation similar to radiation of a meltdown, but it only takes 5 turns to clear<br/>
         - Nuclear Reactors - each turn, there is a 5% chance of a meltdown<br/> 
         - If you do get one, all units 2 cm away will be killed, <br/>
         - and all units less and 5 cm away will lose half of their remaining health each turn that they are there<br/> 
         - Building or sending any units there will be useless<br/> 
         - Radiation will take 20 turns to return to safe levels.<br/>
      </p>
      <br/>
      <h2>Artillery - </h2>
      <p>
         - Artillery deals damage every turn, not just yours, and has a 50% chance of doing so.
         - It only costs the usage cost for all the turns after yours.
      </p>
      <h2>Trench charge - </h2>
      <p>
         - All debuffs on the enemy and you from your trench are eliminated, but the ones you get from the enemy trench are still there. 
         - Infantry & tanks only.
      </p>
      <h2>Nuclear engines - </h2>
      <p>
         - If you equip it with something that makes it useless, then it will go slower and cost MORE fuel, not less.
      </p>
